Creating world file
===================

YATAGE needs what we call a "world file" to be able to run a game: it's a plaintext `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`__-formatted
file (``*.yml``) which is itself structured in a specific fashion.

Here's a kinda useless bare-minimum example world file:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/bare-minimum.yml
    :language: yaml
