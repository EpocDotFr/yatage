    Note
    ----

    This is a (almost) 1:1 reimplementation of the Synacor Challenge text adventure game originally created by Eric Wastl able to be ran by YATAGE. You can find the original game here: https://challenge.synacor.com/.
    You however have to implement the virtual machine needed to run it by yourself, or use my implementation: https://github.com/EpocDotFr/synacor-challenge

    As mentioned above, some parts have indeed not been implemented here because it's outside of the scope of YATAGE. A note (like this one) will be displayed to give further indication when such case is encountered.
