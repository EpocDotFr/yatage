        description: >-
            You're on the sidewalk in front of a building's entrance,
            a sign on top reads "Hendley Associates". Looks like access
            is restricted by a security guard.


            Someone in a hurry exiting the building bumps on you. As
            he walks away, you see he dropped something on the sidewalk.

                        Security guard: "Did you forgot something,
                        Mr. Clark?"

                        Security guard: "Sir, I cannot let you pass
                        without security card."

    Down the street:
        description: >-
            You run past the building, trying to catch up with this
            stranger. There's a hot dog vendor, a press kiosk, some
            people. But no sign of him.
        exits:
            back: Sidewalk
    Building hall:
        description: >-
            You definitively shouldn't be there, but why not pretend
            you're Mr. Clark?
            
            
            There's lifts right there, let's see where it's leading.

                    You have been busted by a security camera.

            It looks a lot like a credit card. On one side, it reads:

                John Clark
