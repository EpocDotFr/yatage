        description: >-
            You're on the sidewalk in front of a building's entrance,
            letters on the top reads "Hendley Associates". Looks like
            access is restricted by a security guard.

            Someone in a hurry exiting the building bumps on you. As
            he walks away, you see he dropped something on the sidewalk.

                        Security guard: "Did you forgot something,
                        Mr. Clark?"

                        Security guard: "Sir, I cannot let you pass
                        without showing a security card."

    Down the street:
        description: >-
            You walk past the building. There's a hot dog vendor, a
            press kiosk, some people. Nothing much more of interest,
            though.

            It looks a lot like a credit card. On one side, it reads:

                John Clark
